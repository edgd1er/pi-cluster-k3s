# MEM_FACTOR = Percentage of available ram to allocate to all zram swap devices which is divided equally by swap_devices number
MEM_FACTOR={{ zram_mem_factor }}
# DRIVE_FACTOR = Virtual uncompressed zram drive size = estimate approx alg compression ratio an results and is the % of the Memfactor
DRIVE_FACTOR={{ zram_drive_factor }}
# COMP_ALG lz4 is faster than lzo but some distro's show compile and operation difference and in use lzo depending on binary may be faster
COMP_ALG={{ zram_comp_alg }}
# SWAP_DEVICES = number of indivial drives sharing memeory provided by MEM_FACTOR each device support multiple streams 1 large drive is generally better
SWAP_DEVICES={{ zram_swap_devices }}
# SWAP_PRI = swap_priority for each drive 75 is a hig order preference and should be well above other swap drives
SWAP_PRI={{ zram_swap_pri }}
# PAGE_CLUSTER default page cluster is 3 which caches fetches in batches of 8 and helps with HDD paging, with zram mem 0 forces single page fetches
# This can help reduce latency and increase performance
PAGE_CLUSTER={{ zram_page_cluster }}
# SWAPPINESS default swappiness is 60 but with increased performance of zram swap 80 garners overall performance gain without excessive load
# Because zram uses compression load is created and even if minimal at intense load periods such as boot any extra load is unwanted
# Unfortunately there is no dynamic load balancing of swappiness as with zram in general operation SWAPINESS=100 will garner performance benefit
# If the overall load is reasonable at high load it will cause load to accumulate.
SWAPPINESS={{ zram_swappiness }}
# If you check my repo there will also be a simple dynamic load branch based SWAPPINESS governor that will get of the hurdle of a static compromise on swappiness
